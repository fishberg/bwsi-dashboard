# Enrollment Questions for Summer program at MIT

| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| WHY is the enrollment link not available/open?? | See our [COVID-19](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/COVID19) announcement, We are changing the enrollment application AND deadlines to match the expected virtual courses that will be provided this summer. |
| Where is the link for the enrollment application? | Student enrolled in the online course have received this [link](https://mit-bwsi.formstack.com/forms/bwsi_student_summer_application_2020), with password. |
| Why didn't I receive the enrollment application? | The summer enrollment application is a link and was sent out to all students registered this year in the BWSIX online course.  If you did not receive it, check your spam/junk email and then contact bwsi-admin@mit.edu to request it again.|
| You ask for 3 choices (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for courses- do I have to do all three? | Enrollment is competitive and you may not get your first choice. Upon acceptance into the program, you will be placed into one (1) course and will need to complete the online portion for that course. |
| When is the teacher recommendation due? | Your teacher recommendation due date is being extended and can be via this [link](https://mit-bwsi.formstack.com/forms/bwsi_teacher_recommendation_2020).|
| Does the teacher recommendation have to be submitted at the same time?/Can it be submitted early? | Your teacher can submit the recommendation at any time now, and will also need the Unique ID number, provided with your online course access (and is also your BWSIX user name) |
| What do I do if I hit submit before the application was complete? | We do not have the resources to edit incomplete enrollment applications, they will be deleted and you will have to re-submit|
| How can I save my application prior to submitting? | Formstack has a "save and submit later" link at the bottom of the page so you can collect all your required information before submitting |
| I have more than 5 honor/awards and cannot fit into the space provided, what should I do? | In order of priority, please list the most important, then most recent, then most relevant ones to you.  Adding more does not increase your chances of acceptance, separate emails with additional information will not be correlated with your application |
| My "List work/volunteer/hobbies/sports" doesn't fit- what should I do? | In order of priority, please list the most important, then most recent, then most relevant ones to you.  Adding more does not increase your chances of acceptance, separate emails with additional information will not be correlated with your application |
| Where do I send my school grades/transcripts? | We do not require school transcripts but rely on your progress in the online course and teacher recommendation for enrollment into the summer program. |

|Since the application asks for your top three choices, would you have to finish at least 50% of your top 3 courses before you apply? | No, just your prefered course.  Not all students can be accepted into their top preference and this will help make sure promising students can be in a personally interesting course. |

|How do I register for Piazza? | See Piazza under Passwords section Q & A; Check the Introductory module or Course Updates in individual course for links and access code |

| After I register on BWSIX, can I change the email for the account? | No, BWSIX.mit.edu is administered by a different organization and we cannot change email/account settings. |
| What email is used for correspondence for BWSI? | We use the email entered by you, the student, on the student online course registration form as the primary method to send updates and information |
| Are there certificates available after completing the online course? | Not yet, but will be by end of March. Certificates will be available at the end of the course and automatically put in the score of the student when selected. |
| When is the Cyber Security/Reverse Engineering Software course going to be available? | We have been delayed in releasing the course.
